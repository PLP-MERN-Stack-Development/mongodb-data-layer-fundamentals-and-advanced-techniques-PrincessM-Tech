# ðŸ“š PLP Bookstore MongoDB Assignment Wk1

Hi there  

This project is my submission for the **PLP MongoDB assignment**. It shows my understanding of setting up a MongoDB database, running CRUD operations, building aggregation pipelines for analysis, and using indexing to improve performance.  Yeah, I was not really a fan of this part of software development but I enjoy Sir Dedan's explanations and review of the work. I really hope to master this as it forms a critical part of the work I'd like to do.

The database **plp_bookstore** demonstrates data variety (genres, authors, years, etc.). Each book has fields like title, author, genre, published_year, price, in_stock, pages, and publisher.

Comments : I beleive that this is just the beginning of my MongoDB journey . Every query I write and every dataset I explore is sharpening my ability to build solutions that matter.
